# Introducing Chartblocks for Data Visualization

There are a lot of visualization tools available online and on the desktop. I am interested in what a visualization tool provides without programming knowledge. The data visualization tool I am introducing this week is Chartblocks. Chartblocks is a cloud-based data visualization tool for small and medium-sized companies, especially those with high visual needs.

I am interested in whether there are changes in Australians’ consumption of different types of meat. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vagifa/meatconsumption) I found includes data on meat consumption by many countries. It consists of the historical and forecast data from 1990 to 2026. So, I can choose the AUS region when visualizing.

Chartblocks don’t have a built-in data cleaning function. The only way to check the abnormal values when using Chartblocks is to make graphs. Luckily, Chartblocks can build a chart in minutes with the easy-to-use chart designer. The data import wizard will take you through the process step by step, choose from dozens of chart types, then customize it from premade chart templates. Users can easily follow the guide to create a chart and edit the chart after finished as users’ needs. Users can even select colors by REB thus some company can easily use their brand colors.

The dataset does not contain missing values and duplicates, so I am not showing the work here. As we can see from the Figure 2, most interestingly, the consumption of the kilogram of poultry per capita is increasing through the years, and the per capita consumption of Sheep is decreasing. It may be because poultry can better meet people's balanced needs for health and food. Its high protein and low-fat characteristics are especially suitable for the elderly and fitness groups.

Surprisingly, Chartblocks brings many benefits. Chartblocks is easy to use, users can make insightful charts without programming knowledge. Great templates, clear data visualization, and the ability to create interactive charts relatively easily. Users can access your charts anytime and anywhere by phone or desktop because the program produces HTML5 charts that work on any browser or device that has an internet connection. This way, you can easily access your charts anytime and anywhere. For example, the graph I made this week can be viewed here. As Chartblock’s Cloud-based feature, the graph can be saved with every click. Users are not likely to lose their work. Chartblocks can save charts in PNG, JPEG, PDF, and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), making them ideal for retina screens and printed on high-quality documents. Users can easily share their charts on websites and social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest directly, which is not likely in other software such as Python, and Excel.

Nevertheless, there are challenges using Chartblocks. It cannot create multiple plots at once, and it is quite difficult to select data. I found Chartblocks hard to subgroup data, prone to human mistakes by selecting by row and taking much time to add legends. It’s not a good choice for large and uncleaned datasets due to no built-in data cleaning functions. The choice of fonts on the legends is very limited. It does not support saving charts by dataset; it can only search charts by name. Can only type in data or import from excel spreadsheets. Not support JSON, Text, and other types.

Overall, it is user-friendly for users without programming experience. It is also a substitute for using Excel, especially for a clean, small dataset, considering Excel's limited inbuilt charts function.
