# Revealing World Meat Consumption Trend

## Context
As everyone knows, meat is one of the main food intakes, it is high in protein and fat that the human body needs. Increasing personal and family income and improved living standards are likely to increase meat consumption. On the other hand, more and more people are changing their diet to a vegan or vegetarian base, both on social media and with people around me. This phenomenon contrasts with the finding that overall meat consumption has increased in the past 20 years worldwide. Therefore, I decided to dig deeper into the same dataset to explore the change in different types of meat consumption in different countries. The [data](https://data.oecd.org/agroutput/meat-consumption.htm) used 2000 to 2019 historical records provided by the OECD Committee for Agriculture (COAG).

## Data Narrative
After separating the meat types and comparing the meat consumption change from 2000 to 2019, one interesting finding is that the meat consumption per capita (across the world) of pork and beef is dropping, by 3% and 5% respectively. While lamb and poultry consumption is increased by 7%, and 51%, respectively. One of the underlying reasons pork and beef consumption is decreasing is that people are threatened by modern trends of healthy eating, for example, the WHO International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) suggests that red meats are more carcinogenic than previously thought.

The 51% increase in poultry consumption and the fact that people in most countries consume more poultries are also surprising. This might also infer that the healthy eating theories significantly affect the meat consumption pattern. Most healthy eating theories say that white meat is generally healthier than red meat.
One unexpected finding is that some developing economies with show a significant increase in the percentage of meat consumption changes. Vietnam happens to be the country with the most significant increase in meat consumption over this period. The industry related to meat in Vietnam must have been prospering during this period with about double in pork consumption, more than 4 times in beef consumption, more than 2 times in lamb consumption, and more than 3 times in poultry consumption.

## Conclusion
In a nutshell, even though many of us are going vegan, the per capita meat intake, especially the poultry intake, is growing worldwide. Furthermore, poultry might become the main meat intake type worldwide, considering its affordability and healthy nature. And the industries related to meat may have a prospering future, especially in developing economies.
